**Dear Prof. Fraser,**

My name is **Jinrui Zhang**, and I am completing a B.Sc. in Mathematics at Jilin University (China, expected 2026).
I am planning to apply to the **MSc in Mathematics (Thesis option)** program at the University of Ottawa for Fall 2026, and I would like to ask whether you are currently considering new MSc students.

My research interests include optimization, dynamical systems, and machine learning.
I have conducted several undergraduate projects combining mathematics and computation, such as *Differential Informed Auto-Encoder* (arXiv: 2410.18593) and implementations of numerical algorithms using NTT and FFT in C++.

I have attached my **CV** and **Statement of Research Interests** for your reference.
I would appreciate it if you could let me know whether my background might fit your current research directions and if you are open to supervising MSc students in 2026.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
**Jinrui Zhang**
